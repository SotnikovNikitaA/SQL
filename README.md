#### Description: The Final Logical Model.vsdx file displays a common communication between several separate systems. The Final Physical Model.mwb file displays the exact elements linking these systems. The SQL Queries.sql file is the possible operations performed on the created database.

#### Business Uses: This process can create a picture of communication between departments. In other words, if there is a need to make changes to a personâ€™s profile and do it quickly, with the database created, it will be much easier to find this profile, and also because, thanks to the relationships established in the database, it is enough to make a change in only one place for them to change for this person in all departments.
